    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>to create a link in HTML we use anchor tag "a"</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images">About the Odin Project</a>
    <p>this opens the link in this same tab instead of opening new tab</p>
    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-links-and-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About the Odin Project</a>
    <p>While href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened
        noopener: The noopener value of the rel attribute ensures that a link opened in a new tab or window
         cannot interact with or access the original page
    <p>Why do we need this added behavior for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The prevention of access that 
        is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks 
        where the opened link may change the original
         webpage to a different one to trick users. This is
          referred to as tabnabbing.</p>
